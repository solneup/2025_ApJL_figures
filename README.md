This repository contains the jupyter notebook for reproducing the figures in the paper.

Hybrid simulation data are needed for some figures. They are generated by the Hybrid-VPIC code.

Fields and plasma moments are saved in HDF5 format. Particle data are originally saved in binary, but have been reduced as numpy array as inputs for reproducing the figures. The following tutorial (by Xiaocan Li) is helpful for analyzing simulation data.
